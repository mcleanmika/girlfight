                    <h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
                    <br>
            <p>
            	The app uses your location to find events near you. You are able to use the search engine to filter events or use the map to look around and see what is happening in your community. Your login will have all your upcoming events saved into your calendar in order to plan and organise. As a member you are able to create your own event to be posted on the map pending approval.

                    <h3>SAFETY & PRIVACY</h3>
                    <br>
            <p>
                In order to ensure the safety of all members. Members must first be verified. All events will be approved through the Girl Fight team. In order to gain information on an event, you again must be verified. When creating an event you are able to set the event settings to private or an open event. Open events will be posted on the map, however closed events mean that you will have to be invited by the admin.
